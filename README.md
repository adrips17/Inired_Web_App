# Inired_Web_App

Web application for Inired company (Aguas de valencia) where I was doing internships. They asked me for a responsive web application that consisted of a user registry and several screens. Once the user has registered successfully, they can access the main page where a map with the places found in the database. You can access the images, information and comments of the place. In addition to adding comments and new places.

I have use to do the web:
 - Html
 - CSS
 - C#
 - Javascript
 - JQuery
 - Bootstrap
 - SQL Server for database
